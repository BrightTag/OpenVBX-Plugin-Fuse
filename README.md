# Twignal â€” OpenVBX Plugin for Call Tracking with Signal Fuse

Many businesses and brands make their phone number available as part of their contact information
on mailers, billboards, online landing pages, and other prominent locations. Business owners that
don't collect information on the source, duration, and conversion of incoming telephone-based leads
are missing a huge opportunity. Those who poll callers with the standard "how did you hear about us"
remain unable to put this information into action in real-time.

Signal Fuse enables a business owner to collect and connect such online and offline customer signals
in real-time. This plugin serves as an example of the simplicity of integrating such information
into a holistic campaign measurement and attribution solution. It is a Signal Fuse plugin for
Twilio's OpenVBX system to seamlessly integrate Call Tracking for Twilio-based telephony systems.

## Install

Drop it in `$OPENVBX_HOME/plugins`.

    cd $OPENVBX_HOME/plugins
    git clone https://github.com/BrightTag/OpenVBX-Plugin-Fuse.git

That's it!

## Usage

When you add/edit a Call Flow in OpenVBX, Twignal will be available as a Voice Applet.
